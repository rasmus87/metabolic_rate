## MCMCglmm

# For the random effect variance prior we will use an inverse-Gamma
# distribution. In MCMCglmm this is described by two parameters: nu and V. These
# terms are related to the shape (alpha) and scale (beta) parameters on an
# inverse-Gamma with alpha = nu/2, and Beta = (nu*V)/2. As we donâ€™t want our
# estimates to be heavily influenced by our prior we will use weakly informative
# prior values such as descripted as V = 1 and nu = 0.002
